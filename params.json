  "body": "# Bluemix platform maintenance\r\n## November 16-21, 2016 - All regions\r\n\r\nIn order to address an urgent, industry-wide security advisory, all virtual machines in the world-wide SoftLayer data centers will need to be patched and in some cases restarted over the next several days, between Nov 16 and Nov 21. The patches/restarts will be staggered to minimize the overall impact to Bluemix users.\r\n\r\nWhile the maintenance is going on, you might experience several windows during which the following situations might occur:\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Bluemix login and application management functions, such as staging, starting, stopping, and Services management might be unavailable.</li>\r\n<li>Running applications might be temporarily unreachable.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nIn addition, every application will be automatically restarted at least once. To minimize disruption, we recommend using at least 3 instances for critical applications.\r\n\r\nMany of the services that Bluemix applications are bound to may also be temporarily unavailable as their data center servers are also restarted or patched. Most of these service restarts will take place during the same maintenance windows listed below. However, some services might be affected at times outside these windows by other data center dependencies.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor the latest status of Bluemix, please see [http://ibm.biz/bluemixstatus](http://ibm.biz/bluemixstatus)",

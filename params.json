The patches/restarts will be staggered to minimize the overall impact to Bluemix users.\r\n\r\nWhile the maintenance is going on, you might experience several windows during which the following situations might occur:\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Bluemix login and application management functions, such as staging, starting, stopping, and Services management might be unavailable.</li>\r\n<li>Running applications might be temporarily unreachable.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nIn addition, every application will be automatically restarted at least once. To minimize disruption, we recommend using at least 3 instances for critical applications.\r\n\r\nMany of the services that Bluemix applications are bound to may also be temporarily unavailable as their data center servers are also restarted or patched. Most of these service restarts will take place during the same maintenance windows listed below. However, some services might be affected at times outside these windows by other data center dependencies.\r\n\r\nFor the US-SOUTH region, the main windows will be:\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>November 16, 06:00 - 12:00 UTC</li>\r\n<li>November 17, 10:30 - 12:30 UTC</li>\r\n<li>November 18, 06:00 - 08:00 UTC</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\nFor the EU-GB region, the main window will be:\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>November 21, 00:00 - 02:00 UTC</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\nFor the AU-SYD region, the main window will be:\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>November 20, 15:00 - 17:00 UTC</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\nAll times and durations are approximative and may be revised as we get closer to the event. Further detailed schedule information, as well as updates during the week, will be appended at the bottom of this page.\r\n\r\nIf you have a Dedicated Bluemix region, specific information, when available, may be posted on the private status page for your region (at [console-url]/status). You may also contact your IBM Client Success Manager or IBM Advocate for more information.\r\n\r\nIn many cases, the duration of each interruption might be less than the full maintenance window. However, we strongly suggest that you take advantage of multi-region deployment of critical applications, where applicable, to minimize the disruption to your production applications. We also recommend using at least 3 instances for each critical application within each individual region. \r\n\r\nThe Bluemix Platform and Services Operation team will take all reasonable steps to minimize the disruption. We will closely monitor the progress and provide periodic general updates both on the main <u><a href=\"http://ibm.biz/bluemixstatus\" target=\"_blank\">Bluemix Status Page</a></u> and on this page, as necessary. \r\n\r\n",
